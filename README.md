## 🇺🇸 English

Item Info Copier is a lightweight Fabric mod designed for Minecraft 1.20.1 - 1.20.4. It allows developers and players to quickly copy item details to the clipboard.

**Note**: While marked as compatible with Minecraft 1.20.1 - 1.20.4, this version has only been fully tested on **1.20.1**.

### ✨ Features
- **Hotkey & Chat Integration**: Press the configured hotkey (`Ctrl+C` by default) while holding an item or hovering over it in an inventory. This action posts a detailed, clickable report into your chat.
- **Click-to-Copy**: Each piece of information in the chat report has a `[Copy]` button next to it for one-click copying.
- **Copy All**: A prominent `[Click to Copy All]` button is included to copy a summary of all visible information at once.
- **Sound Feedback**: Get an audible confirmation click when you copy information using the hotkey or a chat button.
- **Deeply Configurable**: Use the in-game config screen (requires ModMenu) to customize the mod to your liking.
- **Custom Hotkey**: Set your own hotkey for copying using a new, easy-to-use key recorder screen. Provides immediate visual and audio feedback.
- **Toggle Information**: Individually enable or disable copying for:
  - Item Name
  - Namespace ID (e.g., `minecraft:stone`)
  - Translation Key (e.g., `block.minecraft.stone`)
  - Raw/Numeric ID
  - NBT Data
- **Control Copy Locations**: Separately enable or disable the hotkey for items held in your hand versus items in an inventory screen.
